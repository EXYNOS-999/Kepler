TRANSITFIT5 - used to model planetary transits based on Kepler photometry
 -handles multi-planets, RVs and TTVs and deMCMC framework for posteriors. 
 
   transitfit5: Uses Levenberg-Marquardt to fit a transit-model to 
   photometry
   
   transitmcmc5: Uses deMCMC style MCMC to produce Markov-Chains for a 
   transit-model
   
   transitsn5: estimates S/N of transit based on transit model
   
   transittiming5: calculates center of transit-times based on folded 
   transit-model
   
   prdump5: data-dump routine for XML style output
   
   mcmcsetup: estimates Gibbs sampler factors to initialize MCMC routines
   
   transitdepth5: estimate transit-depth from a transit-model
   
   transitcut5: cuts out all observes beyond +/- 1 transit duration
   
   datadump5: removes all but one planet from a lightcurve (for 
   multi-planet systems)
   
   transitdur5: estimates transit-duration from a transit-model 
    
   transitremove5: removes transit-model from a light-curve
   
   transitchisq5: estimates chi-square from lightcurve and transit-model
   
   transitsigclip5: uses 3-sigma clipping to remove outliers based on 
   transit-model fit
   
   plottimeseries: makes a plot of the time-series and marks location of 
   transits
   
   transitplot5: plots the folded lightcurve and transit model
   
   mcmchistnew: produces histogram of a Markov-Chain and estimates 
   median and posteriors
   
   mcmchist5: produces histogram of a Markov-Chain and estimates 
   median and posteriors and uses stellar-parameter MCs to get absolute planet 
   posteriors (e.g. Mp, Rp)
   
   mcmchist5bf: same as mcmchist5 but use best-fit for center of 
   posterior
